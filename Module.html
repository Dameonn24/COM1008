              <p>Officially my degree reads "Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence with a Year in Industry." Mouthful, I know. Essentially, 
                I spend my first three years studying for a basic degree in Computer Science. The fourth year is my "Year in Industry" where I work 
                and accumlate work experience. Finally, my fifth year is my Masters' year in Artificial Intelligence. Then I'm done! Currently, I'm 
                in my first year and listed below the modules I've done so far and little bit about each one. </p>

              <h2><span>COM1001 : Introduction to Software Engineering</span></h2>
              <p>
                As the title of the module clearly states, this module is all about creating and developing software. In this module we are learning 
                to program in a programming language called Ruby and learning about the software development process. A massive component in this 
                module is creating a fully functioning software for a client, who is a fourth year student currently studying at the University of 
                Sheffield as well. In the first semester, we are supposed to create all the documentation regarding the program (yay writing! -.-) 
                and we start actually building the software in the second semester.</br>Overall, the module itself is pretty interesting but there is a 
                lot of content to cover. On top of that, and as much as working as a team is fun, it has its ups and downs especially with the COVID 
                pandemic, but so is life.

              <p>
                By far one of my more confusing module. This module is all about logic and the maths behind it. In all honesty, 
                for the first three weeks, I was so very confused. However, after one night of "stress-studying", I was able to make sense of 
                the backwards E and upside down A, resulting in a First Class for the first quiz I took. Once you are able to make sense of what's 
                being thought, the actual module becomes very interesting. Unfortunately, there is a lot of work and effort that is required by this 
                module just to stay afloat. As I am writing this description, it is safe to say, I will be having another “stress-studying”  very soon 
                in the coming weeks.  While I’m here, I want to shout out to my professors real quick, Dr. Paul and Dr. Mike. 
                Even though the content was tricky to understand and my mind might’ve died a couple of times trying to understand the concept, 
                they made the experience rather enjoyable. So thank you for that! (They probably have no idea who I am :/ )

              <h2><span>COM1003 : Java Programming</span></h2>
              <p>
                Java. Ah yes, the most problematic language I’ve ever had to deal with. Throughout my life, I’ve learnt multiple languages : C++, C, 
                Python, Pascal, (tried French and German but decided to stick to programming languages,) and now I’m learning Ruby and Java. As much as 
                Java has been an absolute pain to work with sometimes, it’s kind of pretty cool. Sure the syntax is long and the actual case could be 
                that I am pretty lazy to type, but I like how ordered the entire program looks and feels in the end. In the end, this module has taught 
                me not to get disheartened quickly and keep trying to crack the problem, even if the problem is java itself. Shoutout to Dr. Siobhan 
                North for making us draw dinosaurs with Java.

                The module that I was most excited for when I started university. As someone who is on the AI masters’ track and plans to go into 
                research after university, I thought I would enjoy this module. Overall, the actual module is really interesting and it's actually 
                crazy to think how computer scientists created the things they did back in the day with limited computer power and hardware. To emphasize 
                how difficult it is to actually make something intelligent, we had to work with a robotic dog named MiRO. MiRO is actually created by The 
                University of Sheffield and it is pretty impressive. It’s got a variety of sensors and overall looks pretty amazing, however as something
                that is still being developed on, it has its set of issues that need fixing and until its fixed, it does give a hard time to the user.

              <p>
                The greatest module ever. That is a fact and I am not just saying this so I can get a higher score :) </br> In all honesty, I particularly didn't pay 
                much attention to this module because at the age of thirteen, I had completed a Diploma in Web Engineering which covered most of everything 
                that was taught in this module. However, the depth that this module went into was much deeper than what I previously learnt and luckily I had experience 
                with HTML and CSS because learning how to write JavaScript was just out of this world. </br></br>

                Amongst all the confusion, this project of creating my own site has helped me in so many ways: I got to be creative and code which felt like a match made in 
                heaven. I was forced to be organised and constantly look at my progress, see if I would make it in time for the deadline. Finally, I 
                wanted a platform to showcase all my digital artwork and essentially create an online presence, and this project was just the perfect to 
                get that done.

              <p>
                A surprising choice for someone who hates writing essays. Now this is an extra module, I literally didn’t have to pick it up but I did. 
                I don’t know why. The module talks about cognitive psychology and essentially how the brain works. I only picked this module because 
                I knew that if I wanted to do research on the brain, I need to know how it works. However, considering the entire module revolves around 
                video lecturers, its safe to say that I have a lot of them to watch.
